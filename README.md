# Getting Started

This is a template file designed to have a quick UI with a global state system and landing page set up. It is based off of Create React App and uses the below tech stack:

- [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/): React Component Library
- mobx: Global state storage
- rainbowkit / [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/docs/getting-started): Ethereum connection and interaction
- [react-toastify](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify): In app messaging

To run, simply run `yarn` and then `yarn start`,
To get started editing, you can edit the file at `src/pages/Landing.tsx`.
